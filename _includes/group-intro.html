Glasgow University Robotics Society (GURS) is a competition based engineering society. We design, build and compete in local and international robotics, embedded and electronics contests. Our mission is to provoke students to think outside of the box, while they work in a strong and motivated team. We believe that hard work is a true path to success. We are open to all sorts of people from different backgrounds and level of expertise, who are passionate about electronics/software/system design/mechanics/control and are ready get their hands dirty!
